New file with right name on it.

Test:

Type git push. To be more specific, type git push origin main. Since you are not dealing with another branch (other than main) or a different remote (as mentioned above),
 you can leave it as git push to save a few keystrokes. NOTE: If at this point you receive a message that says “Support for password authentication was removed on 
 August 13, 2021. Please use a personal access token instead.”, you have followed the steps incorrectly and cloned with HTTPS, not SSH. Please follow these steps to 
 change your remote to SSH, then attempt to push to Github.
